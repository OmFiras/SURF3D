function [X] = generategrid(p)
% GENERATEGRID does the same thing that matlab's NDGRID does, but the input
% and output are compressed into a single cell allowing for more flexible
% implementations.
%
% INPUTS
% p: a cell of vectors of indecies along the size of the grid.
%
% OUTPUT
% X: an array of each of the points in the grid as row vectors. 
%
% NOTES
% The inspiration for this flexible grid machine is the flip clock. I made
% this function because I didn't know ndgrid existed, and I'm too proud
% of my work to delete it. My implementation works by using the number of
% indecies along each dimension as a clock that counts down in order to
% iterate through all the possible combinations of indecies.
