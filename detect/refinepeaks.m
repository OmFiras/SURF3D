function [peaks] = refinepeaks(peaks, A, ~, scale)
% REFINEPEAKS takes the coarse location of PEAKS in A and uses quadratic
% fitting function in order to approximate the true location of the peak
% along dimension D.
%
% INPUT
% peaks: the Mx5 array of peaks from A. Where each peak is the following
% row vector [x,y,z,scale,magnitude].
% A: the 4 dimensional volume from which the peaks were extracted.
% d: the scalar denoting the direction along which to fit the quadratic
% function.
% scale: a row vector containing the scales in the octave.
%
% OUTPUT
% refined: the Mx5 array of peaks from A. Where the dimension d has been
% refined using a quadratic fitting function.
