function [V2] = markkeypoints( V0, points )
%MARKKEYPOINTS marks the POINTS with circles in the volume V0.
%   Points are marked with circles that are the radius of the scale of the
%   detected key point.
%
% INPUTS
% V0: an uint8 greyscale 3 dimensional array.
% points: an Nx4 array of key points [x,y,z,radius].
%
% OUTPUTS
% V2: a cell/stack of uint8 color images. 
% 
% NOTES
% The points are marked as circles existing in the 3 planes parallel to the
% principal directions not as spheres; spheres would be too confusing.
%
% The main for loop can't be done in parallel, but the drawing of the
% circle could be moved out of the while loop into a parfor by pre breaking
% the list of points into groups by slice.
