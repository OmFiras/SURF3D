# SURF3D
Matlab scripts for detecting SURFs in three dimensions based on work by Bay et al. and Willems et al.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a tool for feature matching between volumes in Matlab. The image 
processing toolbox for matlab currently only does 2D image processing, but for applications like x-ray computed 
tomography (XCT) for use by medical and materials researchers, identifying 3D features is useful.
